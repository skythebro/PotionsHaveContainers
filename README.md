# ðŸ«— Potions Have Containers - Gloomrot Update
forked from [phillipsOG/C2ierce](https://github.com/phillipsOG/PotionsHaveContainers) and updated to Gloomrot.


## Potions and flasks will now return their empty counter-part containers. What were we doing before, eating them?
* Works with all potions, flasks/Canteens.
* NEW Blood bottle and blood merlot will now return an empty bottle.
* Because of the abilitygroup of the water bottle and canteen being the same they can both only give back one or the other so I added a config option to choose which one you want.
* The best option would be to not use a water canteen and use the water bottles instead. (it is ofcourse your choice :D)
If there is a non water related potion I have missed be sure to open an issue on [github]([https://github.com/skythebro/PotionsHaveContainers/issues](https://patreon.com/user?u=97347013&utm_medium=clipboard_copy&utm_source=copyLink&utm_campaign=creatorshare_creator&utm_content=join_link)).
