# ðŸ«— Potions Have Containers - Gloomrot Update
forked from [phillipsOG/C2ierce](https://github.com/phillipsOG/PotionsHaveContainers) and updated to Gloomrot.

## Potions and flasks will now return their empty counter-part containers. What were we doing before, eating them?
Works with all potions, flasks/Canteens except for the water bottle and water-filled Canteen.
If there is a non water related potion I have missed be sure to open an issue on [github](https://github.com/skythebro/PotionsHaveContainers/issues).

## Installation
Place the _PotionsHaveContainers.dll_ file inside of (Vrising Server)\BepInEx\plugins folder.

## Configurable Values
```ini

## Enable or Disable PotionsHaveContainers
# Setting type: Boolean

```
